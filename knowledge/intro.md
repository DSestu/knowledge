# David Sestu's Knowledge repo

This repository contains various bits of knowledge that I find helpful for my work.

This may include code snippets, links, but also articles in the future.

These bits of knowledge are mainly focused on data subjects via Python/PostgresSQL.

My repositories:

1. Python project template

[https://github.com/DSestu/python-project-template](https://github.com/DSestu/python-project-template)

This repository aims to make the development experience smooth, efficient, and consistent across different machines and time periods.The template is built with a focus on minimal manual interaction for environment synchronization, allowing developers to dive straight into coding. Options for working in a local isolated environment or within a Docker container are provided.

2. Prefect Windows scheduler

[https://github.com/DSestu/Prefect-Windows-scheduler](https://github.com/DSestu/Prefect-Windows-scheduler)

This project is aimed at providing a simple template for running croned tasks on Windows.

The Windows task scheduler can be a bit of a pain to configure if you have a lot of tasks to run.

For this reason, we use [Prefect](https://docs.prefect.io/) to schedule tasks.

> The absolute goal of this project is to have a very fast and transparent setup so you can just start coding python scripts.
